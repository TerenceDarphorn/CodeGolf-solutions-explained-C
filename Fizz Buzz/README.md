# Fizz Buzz

## The challenge

Print the numbers from **1** to **100** inclusive, each on their own line.

If, however, the number is a multiple of **three** then print `Fizz` instead, and if the number is a multiple of **five** then print `Buzz`.

If multiple conditions hold true then all replacements should be printed, for example **15** should print `FizzBuzz`.

## So:
Each line will either print:
- `FizzBuzz` (for a multiple of 3 AND a multiple of 5. This is effectively a multiple of 15)
- `Fizz` (for a multiple of 3 only, so not a multiple of 5)
- `Buzz` (for a multiple of 5 only, so not a multiple of 3)
- the number itself (when it is not a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 5)
